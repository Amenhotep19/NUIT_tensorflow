# Northwestern Research Computing Python: TensorFlow Workshop

[https://github.com/nuitrcs/NUIT_tensorflow](https://github.com/allemanau/NUIT_tensorflow)

## General Info

General information about RCS Python Workshops can be found in the [Python Workshops Repository](https://github.com/nuitrcs/pythonworkshops).  This includes information about software installations and general Python resources.

## Prep

In order to focus on deep learning and TensorFlow, we will work from Google Colab using this repository. 

Therefore, there is no need to install nor download anything - you will work from notebooks directly in Google Colab. Following the steps below:
- Log in to Google
- Open Google Colab: [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com) 
- Go to File > Open notebook
- Click on the GitHub tab
- Open the notebook we are working on

We will go through the steps together at the end of the short intro presentation.

## Tensorflow Workshop Overview

### Objective of the workshop

Learn the basics of deep learning, and practice implementing basic models with TensorFlow 2.0.

### Learning outcomes

* Learn about fundamental deep learning principles and challenges
*	Practice implementing and evaluating models with TensorFlow and Keras
* Work with convolutional layers, pooling layers, and data augmentation


### Resources

General machine learning, data science, and deep learning resources:

[Data Science Central](https://www.datasciencecentral.com) - A great online group of data science enthusiasts where you can find everything related to machine learning, predictive modeling, data science and more.

[KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/) - A great source of news anything ML and Data Science. 

[Towards Data Science](http://www.towardsdatascience.com) - Place to share concepts, ideas and code

[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [edx](https://www.edx.org/), [udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Kadenze](http://www.kadenze.com) courses. I would strongly recommend Andrew Ng's machine learning courses. 

#### More specific TensorFlow related resources:

General TensorFlow resources and more specific tutorials that cover multiple topics can be found on [Tensorflow Website](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
